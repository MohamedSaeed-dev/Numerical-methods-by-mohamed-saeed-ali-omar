# Numerical-methods-by-mohamed-saeed-ali-omar
I have been working on creating the code of the three numerical methods (bisection,newton,secant) I did it!

all what you need to do is to put your math function in f() and change the code in (if else condtion) according to the condition of your question , that is it.


I hope my code is helpful, any improving please let me know
